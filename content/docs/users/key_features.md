# Functionality of the LeadsCalendar Project

The LeadsCalendar project combines event creation and payment processing functionalities to provide users with a seamless experience. Here's a detailed description of its functionality:

1. **Event Creation:**
    - Users can access the LeadsCalendar web application through a user-friendly interface.
    - Upon logging in or signing up, users are presented with options to create new events.
    - The event creation form typically includes fields such as event title, description, start date, end date, location, and any additional details.

2. **Integration with Google Calendar:**
    - LeadsCalendar integrates with the Google Calendar API to enable users to create events directly within their Google Calendar accounts.
    - When users submit the event creation form, the application sends the event details to the Google Calendar API.
    - If successful, the event is added to the user's Google Calendar, and the user receives a confirmation notification.

3. **Payment Prompt:**
    - After successfully creating an event, users are prompted to make a payment of 1 USD or its equivalent in cryptocurrency before confirming the event.
    - The payment prompt is displayed within the LeadsCalendar interface, usually as a modal or a separate payment section.
    - Users are provided with options to choose their preferred payment method, such as PayPal or Binance Pay.

4. **Integration with Payment Gateways:**
    - LeadsCalendar integrates with PayPal and Binance Pay APIs to facilitate secure payment processing.
    - Upon selecting a payment method, users are redirected to the respective payment gateway's interface to complete the transaction.
    - The application communicates with the payment gateway APIs to initiate and process the payment securely.

5. **Payment Confirmation:**
    - Once the payment is successfully processed, the application receives a confirmation from the payment gateway API.
    - The event creation process is finalized, and the event is officially confirmed.
    - Users receive a confirmation message or email indicating that their event has been successfully created and payment has been processed.

6. **Error Handling:**
    - The application incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios such as failed payment transactions or API errors.
    - In case of errors, users are notified promptly with clear error messages and instructions on how to proceed.
    - Failed payment attempts are logged, and users are guided through alternative payment methods or troubleshooting steps.

7. **User Management:**
    - LeadsCalendar includes features for user management, such as user registration, login, and profile management.
    - Users can update their personal information, manage their events, and view their payment history within the application.
    - Security measures, such as encryption and authentication, are implemented to safeguard user data and ensure privacy.

8. **Accessibility and Usability:**
