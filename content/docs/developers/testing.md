### Testing

Testing is an essential part of ensuring the reliability and functionality of the LeadsCalendar application. Here's a guide on testing the integration with Google Calendar, PayPal, and Binance Pay APIs:

1. **Event Creation Testing:**
    - Create test events using LeadsCalendar and verify that they are successfully added to the user's Google Calendar account.
    - Test different scenarios such as single-day events, multi-day events, recurring events, and events with reminders.

2. **Payment Processing Testing:**
    - Initiate payment transactions using different payment methods (e.g., PayPal, credit/debit cards, cryptocurrency) and verify successful payment processing.
    - Test scenarios for successful payments, failed payments (e.g., insufficient funds, declined transactions), and cancelled payments.

3. **Integration Testing:**
    - Perform integration tests to simulate end-to-end scenarios, including event creation, payment processing, and synchronization with Google Calendar.
    - Test for edge cases and error handling scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability of the application.

4. **Webhooks Testing:**
    - Configure webhooks for PayPal and Binance Pay APIs to receive payment notifications and order updates.
    - Test webhook endpoints to ensure they receive and process notifications correctly, updating event statuses and payment records accordingly.

5. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    - Engage real users or stakeholders to perform user acceptance testing (UAT) by creating events, making payments, and providing feedback on the user experience.
    - Gather feedback on usability, functionality, and any issues encountered during testing to iterate and improve the application.

6. **Load Testing:**
    - Conduct load testing to evaluate the performance and scalability of the application under various load conditions.
    - Simulate concurrent user interactions, event creations, and payment transactions to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize system resources.

7. **Error Handling Testing:**
    - Test error handling mechanisms for gracefully handling exceptions, such as network errors, API rate limits, and invalid user inputs.
    - Verify that error messages are informative and user-friendly, guiding users on how to resolve issues and proceed with the workflow.

8. **Security Testing:**
    - Perform security testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the application, such as data breaches, injection attacks, and unauthorized access.
    - Ensure that sensitive data, such as API credentials and user payment information, is encrypted and securely handled throughout the application.
