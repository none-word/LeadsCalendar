### Recommended Technological Stack

1. **Frontend Framework: React.js**
    - React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - Its component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and declarative syntax make it suitable for developing interactive and responsive UIs.
    - Features such as hooks and context API facilitate state management and component reusability.

2. **Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js**
    - Node.js is a runtime environment that allows server-side JavaScript execution, making it ideal for building scalable and high-performance backend services.
    - Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing, middleware handling, and request/response handling.
    - Together, Node.js and Express.js provide a robust foundation for building RESTful APIs and handling backend logic efficiently.

3. **Database: MongoDB**
    - MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility, scalability, and performance for storing and managing data.
    - Its document-oriented data model and JSON-like documents make it well-suited for handling complex data structures and schema-less data.
    - MongoDB's support for replication, sharding, and high availability ensures reliability and scalability as the application grows.

4. **Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
    - JWT is a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON objects.
    - It can be used for implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms in web applications.
    - JWT-based authentication provides stateless authentication, scalability, and security features such as token expiration and signature verification.
